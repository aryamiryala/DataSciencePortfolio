<h1>Data Science Portfolio</h1>

A collection of data science projects I have done to demonstrate skill sets, knowledge. 
As an NBA fan I was curious if the amount of three pointers made contributes to how high up on the all time points list a player was.

<h1>Contents</h1>

- PythonWebScraping: Simple web scraping example using Python's beautifulsoup and pandas. All work done in Jupyter Notebook and created a csv file from data found on real website after converting it into a pandas dataframe

- ExploratoryDataAnalysis: performed Exploratory Data Analysis on csv I generated from webscraping. Took steps such as importing and reading the data, understanding the data, preparing and cleaning up the data, feature understanding, and lastly exported cleaned up data back to a csv file for visualizations.

<h1>In Progress</h1>

- SQL Projects
- Data Visualization of CSV file I made
